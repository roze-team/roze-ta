# Roadmap

This roadmap describes the project's direction at a high level. It is
intentionally non-binding: priorities shift with feedback and available time,
and the authoritative, up-to-date view of planned work is the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/wickra-lib/wickra/issues). Shipped changes
are recorded in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

## Status

Wickra is at **1.0**. The public API follows semantic versioning: a breaking
change requires a major release, and every change is recorded in the changelog.

## Themes

- **Indicator coverage.** Continue broadening the indicator catalogue across
  families (trend, momentum, volatility, volume, statistics, market profile,
  and more), each with the same streaming/batch parity and test guarantees.
- **API stability.** The public `Indicator` and `BarBuilder` traits and the
  binding surfaces are settled as of 1.0; keep them that way and reserve
  breaking changes for a major release.
- **Performance.** Keep a tick free of any pass over the history behind it, and maintain the benchmark suite;
  investigate further allocation and cache improvements.
- **Bindings parity.** Keep the Python, Node.js and WASM bindings — plus
  the C ABI and the C#, Go, Java and R bindings generated from it — in lockstep with the
  Rust core, including type stubs and platform coverage.
- **Documentation.** Maintain a deep-dive page per indicator on
  <https://docs.wickra.org>, plus quickstarts and cookbook material.
- **Project health.** Maintain test coverage, static and dynamic analysis,
  signed releases, and supply-chain monitoring.
