"""Generic golden replay: every scalar indicator in scalar_manifest.json is
constructed by its native name with the recorded params, fed the shared golden
input, and checked against the Rust-generated g_<Canonical>.csv.
The comparison is a relative tolerance, not bit equality. Every binding calls
into the same Rust core, so 461 of the 514 indicators are bit-identical by
construction; the other 53 reach a transcendental in the platform math library
(`ln`, `sin`, `cos`, `atan`, `exp`), which no mainstream libm rounds correctly
and which differs in the last bit between implementations. Tightening this to an
exact comparison would make the suite fail on a machine whose libm rounds
differently, which is not a defect in Wickra.


This ties the Python binding to the Rust reference for the whole scalar-output
tranche (not just the seven archetype representatives). Fixtures + manifest are
produced by `cargo run -p wickra-examples --bin gen_golden`.
