//! Numerically stable rolling moments.
//!
//! The textbook incremental variance `E[x²] − E[x]²` is cheap and O(1), but it
//! cancels catastrophically once the values are large relative to their spread —
//! which is exactly the shape of a price series. Measured against a two-pass
//! reference over a 20-bar window of `level + sin(i · 0.7) · spread`:
//!
//! | level | spread | `E[x²] − E[x]²` | shifted |
//! |-------|--------|-----------------|---------|
//! | 1e2   | 1      | 3.9e-12         | 3.3e-16 |
//! | 1e2   | 0.01   | 9.0e-08         | 5.1e-16 |
//! | 1e5   | 1      | 4.3e-06         | 1.6e-16 |
//! | 1e5   | 0.01   | **9.4e-02**     | 1.3e-16 |
//! | 1e8   | 1      | **1.0**         | 4.9e-16 |
//!
//! At 1e8 the naive form does not merely lose digits: `sum_sq / n` and
//! `mean · mean` agree to every bit, the difference is exactly zero, and the
//! `.max(0.0)` clamp that was meant to absorb rounding noise hides the collapse
//! completely. A squeeze indicator then reports a permanent squeeze and a
//! z-score divides by zero dispersion. Bitcoin at 100 000 on one-second bars sits
//! in the 1e5 / 0.01 row.
//!
//! `ShiftedMoments` fixes this by accumulating the moments of `x − offset`
//! instead of `x`, where `offset` is a value from inside the window. The
//! subtraction is exact in the common case and near-exact otherwise, so the
//! cancellation that remains is between quantities of order `spread²` rather
//! than `level²`. Cost is unchanged: one add and one subtract per bar, plus an
//! amortised reseed.
//!
//! It deliberately does **not** own the window. Every indicator that needs this
//! already keeps its own values (most in a `VecDeque`, some in a ring buffer),
//! often for other purposes too, so the accumulator attaches to whatever the
//! caller already has and is driven by `push` / `evict`.

/// Rolling `Σ(x − offset)` and `Σ(x − offset)²` for a fixed-length window.
